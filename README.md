Ocular
======

This is the main code for Ocular, my devops monitoring tool, which is built for the Arduino.

Ocular is a LCD based device that allows you to view information
relating to your application. The idea is to allow me to get a quick
overview of what is going on with a project without having to open up my
browser.

At present it only displays the last commit and deployment and is very
much coupled to the tools I use at home and at work. Ideally this will
be improved over time.

Please feel free to fork the project with any tweaks you think it may
require. 

There are two parts to Ocular, the code needed for the device and the [API](http://github.com/baphle/ocular_api).

Warning:

It's still a working progress and therefore likely to change quite alot
and is not guaranteed to work brilliantly. I still need to polish up the
API and get finalise the actual design of the device.

For instruction on creating your own Ocular device checkout the [breadboard diagram](http://raw.github.com/baphled/Ocular/master/breadboard.png).
